  title: Google PageSpeed demo reports
  text: PageSpeed Insights is an online synthetic benchmark tool which helps in
    identifying performance best practices on any single URL, provides
    suggestions on a webpage's optimizations, and suggests overall ideas of how
    to make a website faster. Per URL request, it grades webpage performance on
    a scale from 1 to 100 and provides a report on suggested optimizations,
    divided into categories of high, medium, and low priorities.
