    title: Google PageSpeed Insights
    text: PageSpeed Insights is an online synthetic benchmark tool which helps in
      identifying performance best practices on any single URL, provides
      suggestions on a webpage's optimizations, and suggests overall ideas of
      how to make a website faster. Per URL request, it grades webpage
      performance on a scale from 1 to 100 and provides a report on suggested
      optimizations, divided into categories of high, medium, and low
      priorities.

    text: Calculating the carbon emissions of website is somewhat of a challenge,
      but we have been working for many years to develop and refine a
      methodology for this purpose. Our hope is that this will help raise
      awareness and encourage more eco-friendly approaches to be adopted
      throughout the web design industry.
