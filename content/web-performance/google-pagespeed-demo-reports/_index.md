  title: Google PageSpeed demo reports
  text: PageSpeed Insights is an online synthetic benchmark tool which helps in
    identifying performance best practices on any single URL, provides
    suggestions on a webpage's optimizations, and suggests overall ideas of
    how to make a website faster. Per URL request, it grades webpage
    performance on a scale from 1 to 100 and provides a report on suggested
    optimizations, divided into categories of high, medium, and low
    priorities.
