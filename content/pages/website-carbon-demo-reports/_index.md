    text: Calculating the carbon emissions of website is somewhat of a challenge,
      but we have been working for many years to develop and refine a
      methodology for this purpose. Our hope is that this will help raise
      awareness and encourage more eco-friendly approaches to be adopted
      throughout the web design industry.
