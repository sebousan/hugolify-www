    title: Google PageSpeed Insights
    text: PageSpeed Insights is an online synthetic benchmark tool which helps in
      identifying performance best practices on any single URL, provides
      suggestions on a webpage's optimizations, and suggests overall ideas of
      how to make a website faster. Per URL request, it grades webpage
      performance on a scale from 1 to 100 and provides a report on suggested
      optimizations, divided into categories of high, medium, and low
      priorities.
